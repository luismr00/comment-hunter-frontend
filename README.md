# comment-hunter-dev

## Introduction

This is the initial prototype for the front-end development for comment hunter. When making adjustments to the repo, create a branch instead when cloning the repo before pushing any new changes. More details about branching will be provided later. To start, you open your terminal in your IDE where you have this directory open and type in the command:

-npm init
